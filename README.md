### Hey 👋, this is Cem.

I'm a passionate software developer living in Izmir, Turkey. I love being part of development of web applications and data science. I love open source development and I build things on my GitHub profile (here) when I manage to find some time. I love C++, Python, Java and recently JavaScript.
